# Brain Tumor Detection Using Deep Learning on MRI Images

This project performs **multi-class brain tumor classification** using a **VGG16-based convolutional neural network**. It processes MRI images of four categories: **glioma**, **meningioma**, **pituitary**, and **no tumor**, using Keras and TensorFlow.

## Dataset

The dataset used is organized as:
/Training/
â”œâ”€â”€ glioma/
â”œâ”€â”€ meningioma/
â”œâ”€â”€ pituitary/
â””â”€â”€ notumor/

/Testing/
â”œâ”€â”€ glioma/
â”œâ”€â”€ meningioma/
â”œâ”€â”€ pituitary/
â””â”€â”€ notumor/
